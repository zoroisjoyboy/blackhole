### Description
Warphole simulates the gravational lensing affect of when light intercepts a blackhole. Light bends around the space time curvature caused by the blackhole and Einestein's ring forms as the blackhole passes through the light source. The simulation shows what happens when a blackhole moves in front of various two defined light sources: stars and galaxies.
